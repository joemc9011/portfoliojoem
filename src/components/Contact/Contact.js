  <h1>Hi!</h1>
 
  
  <p> My name is Joe McAndrew. I am a creative and motivated individual. Adopted from Peru and thriving in New Jersey,
        I have managed to carve multiple successful roles for myself throughout the years. Within the last 10 years
        I have been successful with standup comedy and graphic design.
        Both feilds were met with determination, self-discipline, and free food in
        lieu of payment. Web development is my next mountain to scale.
        I am very confident I can achieve success within this field due to my ability to
        find and create rewarding lanes for myself, and determination.</p>
